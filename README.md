# Avalanche

## Fiction as Functions!

Welcome to the Avalanche Github repo. The goal of this project is to create novel writing software that treats characters, settings, plots, etc as functions with outputs affected by each other.

Example:
* Character A likes Apples
* Character B hates Apples
* Character B tells Character A how much they hate apples
* Character A evaluates the statement and produces a result
* Result -> A now dislikes character B.

Character functions will be created by the author and should automatically evaluate as the author writes.

Graphs will be created based on these functions so that the author can easily track what
